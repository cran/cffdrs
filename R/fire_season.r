#' Fire Season Start and End
#'
#' @description \code{\link{fire_season}} calculates the start and end fire
#' season dates for a given weather station. The current method used in the
#' function is based on three consecutive daily maximum temperature thresholds
#' (Wotton and Flannigan 1993, Lawson and Armitage 2008). This function process
#' input from a single weather station.
#'
#' An important aspect to consider when calculating Fire Weather Index (FWI)
#' System variables is a definition of the fire season start and end dates
#' (Lawson and Armitage 2008). If a user starts calculations on a fire season
#' too late in the year, the FWI System variables may take too long to reach
#' equilibrium, thus throwing off the resulting indices. This function presents
#' two method of calculating these start and end dates, adapted from Wotton and
#' Flannigan (1993), and Lawson and Armitage (2008). The approach taken in this
#' function starts the fire season after three days of maximum temperature
#' greater than 12 degrees Celsius. The end of the fire season is determined
#' after three consecutive days of maximum temperature less than 5 degrees
#' Celsius.  The two temperature thresholds can be adjusted as parameters in
#' the function call. In regions where temperature thresholds will not end a
#' fire season, it is possible for the fire season to span multiple years, in
#' this case setting the multi.year parameter to TRUE will allow these
#' calculations to proceed.
#'
#' This fire season length definition can also feed in to the overwinter DC
#' calculations (\link{overwinter_drought_code}). View the cffdrs package help
#' files for an example of using the \code{fire_season},
#' \link{overwinter_drought_code}, and \link{fwi} functions in conjunction.
#'
#' @param input A data.frame containing input variables of including the
#' date/time and daily maximum temperature. Variable names have to be the same
#' as in the following list, but they are case insensitive. The order in which
#' the input variables are entered is not important either.

#' @param consistent.snow Is consistent snow data in the input? (default=FALSE)
#' @param multi.year Should the fire season span multiple years?
#' (default=FALSE)
#' @return \link{fire_season} returns a data frame of season and start and end
#' dates. Columns in data frame are described below.

  # Description:
  #   Calculation of fire season. The intent of this function is to allow
  #   for calculation of the start and end dates of a fire season. Knowledge
  #   of the start and end dates allows for more accurate calculation of Fire
  #   Weather Indices. Only 1 method is presented here, however future
  #   modifications will allow the inclusion of other methods.
  #
  #   The current method contained within are contained in the following
  #   article:

  #   Wotton B.M. and Flannigan, M.D. 1993. Length of the fire season in a
  #     changing climate. Forestry Chronicle, 69: 187-192.

  #   **Note that snow depth/cover is not currently included due to a lack of
  #     widespread snow coverage data, however this will be a future addition.
  #
  # Args:
  #   input:    Single station weather data input stream - view fire_season.Rd
  #             documentation for full description.
  #   fs.start: Temperature threshold to start the fire season (deg celcius)
  #   fs.end:   Temperature threshold to end the fire season (deg celcius)
  #   method:   Fire Season calculation method. The default and only current
  #             method being used is "WF93".
  #   consistent.snow  TRUE/FALSE value if consistent snow data is available
  #             if it is not, then we will default to WF93.
