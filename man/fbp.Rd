Fire Behavior Prediction System function
}
\description{
\code{fbp} calculates the outputs from the Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) System (Forestry Canada Fire Danger Group 1992) based on given fire weather and fuel moisture conditions (from the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System (Van Wagner 1987)), fuel type, date, and slope. Fire weather, for the purpose of FBP System calculation, comprises observations of 10 m wind speed and direction at the time of the fire, and two associated outputs from the Fire Weather Index System, the Fine Fuel Moisture Content (FFMC) and Buildup Index (BUI). FWI System components can be calculated with the sister function \code{\link{fwi}}.

\usage{
fbp(input, output="Primary",m=NULL,cores=1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{input}{
    The input data, a data.frame containing fuel types, fire weather component, and slope (see below). Each vector of inputs defines a single FBP System prediction for a single fuel type and set of weather conditions. The data.frame can be used to evaluate the FBP System for a single fuel type and instant in time, or multiple records for a single point (e.g., one weather station, either hourly or daily for instance) or multiple points (multiple weather stations or a gridded surface). All input variables have to be named as listed below, but they are case insensitive, and do not have to be in any particular order. Fuel type is of type character; other arguments are numeric. Missing values in numeric variables could either be assigned as NA or leave as blank.\cr

  \item{output}{
    FBP output offers 3 options (see details in \bold{Values} section):

    }
  }
  \item{m}{
    Optimal number of pixels at each iteration of computation when \code{nrow(input) >= 1000}. Default \code{m = NULL}, where the function will assign \code{m = 1000} when \code{nrow(input)} is between 1000 and 500,000, and \code{m = 3000} otherwise. By including this option, the function is able to process large dataset more efficiently. The optimal value may vary with different computers.  
  }
  \item{cores}{
    Number of CPU cores (integer) used in the computation, default is 1.  By signing \code{cores > 1}, the function will apply parallel computation technique provided by the \code{foreach} package, which significantly reduces the computation time for large input data (over a million records). For small dataset, \code{cores=1} is actually faster. 
  }
* Elevation is only used in the calculation of Foliar Moisture Content (FMC). However, FMC can also be calculated without elevation input. The default is to not use elevation in the calculation of FMC.

\details{
The Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) System (Forestry Canada Fire Danger Group 1992) is a subsystem of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System, which also includes the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System. The FBP System provides quantitative estimates of head fire spread rate, fuel consumption, fire intensity, and a basic fire description (e.g., surface, crown) for 16 different important forest and rangeland types across Canada. Using a simple conceptual model of the growth of a point ignition as an ellipse through uniform fuels and under uniform weather conditions, the system gives, as a set of secondary outputs, estimates of flank and back fire behavior and consequently fire area perimeter length and growth rate. 

The FBP System evolved since the mid-1970s from a series of regionally developed burning indexes to an interim edition of the nationally develop FBP system issued in 1984. Fire behavior models for spread rate and fuel consumption were derived from a database of over 400 experimental, wild and prescribed fire observations. The FBP System, while providing quantitative predictions of expected fire behavior is intended to supplement the experience and judgment of operational fire managers (Hirsch 1996). 

The FBP System was updated with some minor corrections and revisions in 2009 (Wotton et al. 2009) with several additional equations that were initially not included in the system. This fbp function included these updates and corrections to the original equations and provides a complete suite of fire behavior prediction variables. Default values of optional input variables provide a reasonable mid-range setting. Latitude, longitude, elevation, and the date are used to calculate foliar moisture content, using a set of models defined in the FBP System; note that this latitude/longitude-based function is only valid for Canada. If the Foliar Moisture Content (FMC) is specified directly as an input, the fbp function will use this value directly rather than calculate it. This is also true of other input variables.

Note that Wind Direction (WD) is the compass direction from which wind is coming. Wind azimuth (not an input) is the direction the wind is blowing to and is 180 degrees from wind direction; in the absence of slope, the wind azimuth is coincident with the direction the head fire will travel (the spread direction azimuth, RAZ). Slope aspect is the main compass direction the slope is facing. Slope azimuth (not an input) is the direction a head fire will spread up slope (in the absence of wind effects) and is 180 degrees from slope aspect (Aspect).  Wind direction and slope aspect are the commonly used directional identifiers when specifying wind and slope orientation respectively.  The input theta specifies an angle (given as a compass bearing) at which a user is interested in fire behavior predictions; it is typically some angle off of the final spread rate direction since if for instance theta=RAZ (the final spread azimuth of the fire) then the rate of spread at angle theta (TROS) will be equivalent to ROS.

*These outputs represent fire behaviour at a point on the perimeter of an elliptical fire defined by a user input angle theta. theta represents the bearing of a line running between the fire ignition point and a point on the perimeter of the fire. It is important to note that in this formulation the theta is a bearing and does not represent the angle from the semi-major axis (spread direction) of the ellipse. This formulation is similar but not identical to methods presented in Wotton et al (2009) and Tymstra et al (2009).
