\usage{
fwi(
  input,
  init = data.frame(ffmc = 85, dmc = 6, dc = 15, lat = 55),
  batch = TRUE,
  out = "all",
  lat.adjust = TRUE,
  uppercase = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A dataframe containing input variables of daily weather
observations taken at noon LST. Variable names have to be the same as in the
following list, but they are case insensitive. The order in which the input
variables are entered is not important.

\tabular{lll}{
\var{id} \tab (optional)
\tab Unique identifier of a weather\cr
\tab\tab station or spatial point (no restriction on\cr
\tab\tab data type); required when \code{batch=TRUE}\cr
\var{lat} \tab (recommended) \tab Latitude (decimal degree, default=55)\cr
\var{long} \tab (optional) \tab Longitude (decimal degree)\cr
\var{yr} \tab (optional) \tab Year of observation;
required when \code{batch=TRUE}\cr
\var{mon} \tab (recommended) \tab Month of the year
   (integer 1-12, default=7)\cr
\var{day} \tab (optional) \tab Dayof the month (integer); required when
   \code{batch=TRUE}\cr
\var{temp} \tab (required) \tab Temperature (centigrade)\cr
\var{rh} \tab (required) \tab Relative humidity (\%)\cr
\var{ws} \tab (required) \tab 10-m height wind speed (km/h)\cr
\var{prec} \tab (required) \tab 24-hour rainfall (mm)\cr }}

\item{init}{A data.frame or vector contains either the initial values for
FFMC, DMC, and DC or the same variables that were calculated for the
previous day and will be used for the current day's calculation. The
function also accepts a vector if the initial or previous day FWI values is
for only one weather station (a warning message comes up if a single set of
initial values is used for multiple weather stations). Defaults are the
standard initial values for FFMC, DMC, and DC defined as the following:
\tabular{lll}{
\bold{Variable} \tab \bold{Description} \tab \bold{Default} \cr
\var{ffmc}
   \tab Previous day Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC; unitless) \tab 85 \cr
\var{dmc} \tab Previous day Duff Moisture Code (DMC; unitless)\tab 6 \cr
\var{dc} \tab Previous Day Drought Code (DC; unitless) \tab 15\cr
\var{lat} \tab Latitude of the weather station (\emph{Optional}) \tab 55 \cr}}

\item{batch}{Whether the computation is iterative or single step, default is
TRUE. When \code{batch=TRUE}, the function will calculate daily FWI System
outputs for one weather station over a period of time chronologically with
the initial conditions given (\code{init}) applied only to the first day of
calculation. If multiple weather stations are processed, an additional "id"
column is required in the input to label different stations, and the data
needs to be sorted by date/time and "id".  If \code{batch=FALSE}, the
function calculates only one time step (1 day) base on either the initial
start values or the previous day's FWI System variables, which should also
be assigned to \code{init} argument.}

\item{out}{The function offers two output options, \code{out="all"} will
produce a data frame that includes both the input and the FWI System
outputs; \code{out="fwi"} will generate a data frame with only the FWI
system components.}

\item{lat.adjust}{The function offers options for whether day length
adjustments should be applied to the calculations.  The default value is
"TRUE".}

\item{uppercase}{Output in upper cases or lower cases would be decided by
this argument. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
\code{fwi} returns a dataframe which includes both the input and the
FWI System variables as described below:

\description{
\code{fwi} is used to calculate the outputs of the Canadian
Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System for one day or one fire season based
on noon local standard time (LST) weather observations of temperature,
relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour rainfall, as well as the previous
day's fuel moisture conditions. This function could be used for either one
weather station or for multiple weather stations.

The Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System is a major subsystem of
the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System, which also includes Canadian
Forest Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) System. The modern FWI System was
first issued in 1970 and is the result of work by numerous researchers from
across Canada. It evolved from field research which began in the 1930's and
regional fire hazard and fire danger tables developed from that early
research.

The modern System (Van Wagner 1987) provides six output indices which
represent fuel moisture and potential fire behavior in a standard pine
forest fuel type. Inputs are a daily noon observation of fire weather, which
consists of screen-level air temperature and relative humidity, 10 meter
open wind speed and 24 accumulated precipitation.

The first three outputs of the system (the Fire Fuel Moisture Code (ffmc),
the Duff Moisture Code (dmc), and the Drought Code (dc)) track moisture in
different layers of the fuel making up the forest floor. Their calculation
relies on the daily fire weather observation and also, importantly, the
moisture code value from the previous day as they are in essence bookkeeping
systems tracking the amount of moisture (water) in to and out of the layer.
It is therefore important that when calculating FWI System outputs over an
entire fire season, an uninterrupted daily weather stream is provided; one
day is the assumed time step in the models and thus missing data must be
filled in.

The next three outputs of the System are relative (unitless) indicators of
aspects of fire behavior potential: spread rate (the Initial Spread Index,
isi), fuel consumption (the Build-up Index, bui) and fire intensity per unit
length of fire front (the Fire Weather Index, fwi).  This final index, the
fwi, is the component of the System used to establish the daily fire danger
level for a region and communicated to the public.  This final index can be
transformed to the Daily Severity Rating (dsr) to provide a more
reasonably-scaled estimate of fire control difficulty.

Both the Duff Moisture Code (dmc) and Drought Code (dc) are influenced by
day length (see Van Wagner 1987). Day length adjustments for different
ranges in latitude can be used (as described in Lawson and Armitage 2008
(\url{https://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/pubwarehouse/pdfs/29152.pdf})) and are included
in this R function; latitude must be positive in the northern hemisphere and
negative in the southern hemisphere.

The default initial (i.e., "start-up") fuel moisture code values (FFMC=85,
DMC=6, DC=15) provide a reasonable set of conditions for most springtime
conditions in Canada, the Northern U.S., and Alaska. They are not suitable
for particularly dry winters and are presumably not appropriate for
different parts of the world.

library(cffdrs)
# The test data is a standard test
# dataset for FWI system (Van Wagner and Pickett 1985)
data("test_fwi")
# Show the data, which is already sorted by time:
head(test_fwi)
# long  lat	yr	mon	day	temp	rh	ws	prec
# -100	40	1985	4	  13	17	  42	25	0
# -100	40	1985	4	  14	20	  21	25	2.4
# -100	40	1985	4	  15	8.5	  40	17	0

# -100	40	1985	4	  17	13	  34	24	0

## (1) FWI System variables for a single weather station:
# Using the default initial values and batch argument,
# the function calculate FWI variables chronically:
fwi.out1 <- fwi(test_fwi)
# Using a different set of initial values:
fwi.out2 <- fwi(
  test_fwi,
  init = data.frame(ffmc = 80, dmc = 10, dc = 16, lat = 50)
)
# This could also be done as the following:
fwi.out2 <- fwi(test_fwi, init = data.frame(80, 10, 6, 50))
# Or:
fwi.out2 <- fwi(test_fwi, init = c(80, 10, 6, 50))
# Latitude could be ignored, and the default value (55) will
# be used:
fwi.out2 <- fwi(test_fwi, init = data.frame(80, 10, 6))

## (2) FWI for one or multiple stations in a single day:
# Change batch argument to FALSE, fwi calculates FWI
# components based on previous day's fwi outputs:

fwi.out3 <- fwi(test_fwi, init = fwi.out1, batch = FALSE)
# Using a suite of initials, assuming variables from fwi.out1
# are the initial values for different records.
init_suite <- fwi.out1[, c("FFMC", "DMC", "DC", "LAT")]
# Calculating FWI variables for one day but with multiple
# stations. Because the calculations is for one time step,
# batch=FALSE:
fwi.out4 <- fwi(test_fwi, init = init_suite, batch = FALSE)

## (3) FWI for multiple weather stations over a period of time:
# Assuming there are 4 weather stations in the test dataset, and they are
# ordered by day:
test_fwi$day <- rep(1:(nrow(test_fwi) / 4), each = 4)
test_fwi$id <- rep(1:4, length(unique(test_fwi$day)))
# Running the function with the same default initial inputs, will receive a
# warning message, but that is fine:
fwi(test_fwi)

## (4) Daylength adjustment:
# Change latitude values where the monthly daylength adjustments
# are different from the standard ones
test_fwi$lat <- 22
# With daylength adjustment
fwi(test_fwi)[1:3, ]
# Without daylength adjustment
fwi(test_fwi, lat.adjust = FALSE)[1:3, ]
