\usage{
sdmc(input, sdmc_old = NULL, batch = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A data.frame containing input variables of daily noon weather
observations. Variable names have to be the same as in the following list,
but they are case insensitive. The order in which the input variables are
entered is not important either.

\tabular{lll}{
\var{temp} \tab (required) \tab Temperature (centigrade)\cr
\var{rh} \tab (required) \tab Relative humidity (\%)\cr
\var{ws} \tab (required) \tab 10-m height wind speed (km/h)\cr
\var{prec} \tab (required) \tab 1-hour rainfall (mm)\cr
\var{mon} \tab (recommended) \tab Month of the observations (integer 1-12)\cr
\var{day} \tab (optional) \tab Day of the observations (integer)\cr }}

\item{sdmc_old}{Previous day's value of SDMC. At the start of calculations,
when there is no calculated previous day's SDMC value to use, the user must
specify an estimate of this value.  Where \code{sdmc_old=NULL}, the function
will calculate the initial SDMC values based on the initial DMC. The
\code{sdmc_old} argument can accept a single initial value for multiple
weather stations, and also accept a vector of initial values for multiple
weather stations.}

\item{batch}{Whether the computation is iterative or single step, default is
TRUE. When \code{batch=TRUE}, the function will calculate daily SDMC for one
weather station over a period of time iteratively. If multiple weather
stations are processed, an additional "id" column is required in the input
to label different stations, and the data needs to be sorted by date/time
and "id".  If \code{batch=FALSE}, the function calculates only one time step
base on either the previous day's SDMC or the initial start value.}
}
\value{
\code{sdmc} returns either a single value or
   a vector of SDMC values.

\description{
\code{sdmc} is used to calculate
sheltered DMC (sDMC, Wotton et al., 2005) based on daily noon weather
observations of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, 24-hour rainfall,
and a previous day's calculated or estimated value of sDMC. This function
calculates sDMC for either one weather station or for multiple weather
stations over the duration of the daily weather data set, typically over a
fire season.

The Duff Moisture Code (DMC) component of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather
Index (FWI) System tracks moisture content of the forest floor away from the
sheltering influences of overstory trees.  This sheltered Duff Moisture Code
(sDMC) was developed to track moisture in the upper 5 cm of the organic
layer in the rain sheltered areas near (<0.5 m) the boles of overstory trees
(Wotton et al. 2005), an area where lightning strikes usually ignite the
forest floor when they run to ground. The sDMC is very similar in structure
(and identical in data requirements) to the DMC.  The sDMC, like all the FWI
System moisture codes, is a bookkeeping system that tracks gain and loss of
moisture from day-to-day; thus an estimate of the previous day's sDMC value
is needed to provide a starting point for each day's moisture calculation.
Like the other moisture codes in the FWI System the sDMC is converted from a
moisture content value to an outputted CODE value which increases in value
with decreasing moisture content.

\examples{

library(cffdrs)
data("test_sdmc")
# order the data:
test_sdmc <- test_sdmc[with(test_sdmc, order(yr, mon, day)), ]
# (1)Default of sdmc, calculate sdmc for a chronical period of time.
# Because sdmc_old is better to be calculated, we normally
# ignore this option:
test_sdmc$SDMC <- sdmc(test_sdmc)
# (2) multiple weather stations:
# Batch process with multiple stations (2 stations) assuming
# they are from the same month:
test_sdmc$mon <- 7
test_sdmc$day <- rep(1:24, 2)
test_sdmc$id <- rep(1:2, each = 24)
# Sort the data by date and weather station id:
test_sdmc <- test_sdmc[with(test_sdmc, order(yr, mon, day, id)), ]
# Apply the function
test_sdmc$SDMC_mult_stn <- sdmc(test_sdmc, batch = TRUE)
# Assuming each record is from a different weather station, and
# calculate only one time step:
foo <- sdmc(test_sdmc, batch = FALSE)
