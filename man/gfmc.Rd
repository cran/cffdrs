Grass Fuel Moisture Code
}
\description{
\code{gfmc} calculates both the moisture content of the surface of a fully cured matted grass layer and also an equivalent Grass Fuel Moisture Code (gfmc) (Wotton, 2009) to create a parallel with the hourly ffmc (see the \code{\link{fwi}} and \code{\link{hffmc}}functions). The calculation is based on hourly (or sub-hourly) weather observations of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and solar radiation. The user must also estimate an initial value of the gfmc for the layer. This function could be used for either one weather station or multiple weather stations. 
}
\usage{
gfmc(input, GFMCold=85,batch=TRUE,time.step=1,roFL=0.3, out="GFMCandMC")
}
\arguments{
  \item{input}{
    A dataframe containing input variables of daily noon weather observations. Variable names have to be the same as in the following list, but they are case insensitive. The order in which the input variables are entered is not important. 

    \tabular{lll}{
        \var{temp} \tab (required) \tab Temperature (centigrade)\cr    
        \var{rh}   \tab (required) \tab Relative humidity (\%)\cr
        \var{ws}   \tab (required) \tab 10-m height wind speed (km/h)\cr
        \var{prec} \tab (required) \tab 1-hour rainfall (mm)\cr
        \var{isol} \tab (required) \tab Solar radiation (kW/m^2)\cr
        \var{mon}  \tab (recommended) \tab Month of the year (integer 1-12)\cr
        \var{day}  \tab (optional) \tab Day of the month (integer)\cr
    }
  }
  \item{GFMCold}{
    Previous value of GFMC (i.e. value calculated at the previous time step)[default is 85 (which corresponds to a moisture content of about 16\%)]. On the first calculation this is the estimate of the GFMC value at the start of the time step. The \code{GFMCold} argument can accept a single initial value for multiple weather stations, and also accept a vector of initial values for multiple weather stations. 
NOTE: this input represents the CODE value, not a direct moisture content value. The CODE values in the Canadian FWI System increase within decreasing moisture content. To roughly convert a moisture content value to a CODE value on the FF-scale (used in the FWI Systems FFMC) use   \code{GFMCold} =101-gmc  (where gmc is moisture content in \%) 

  }

  \item{time.step}{
    Time step (hour) [default 1 hour]
  }
  \item{roFL}{
    The nominal fuel load of the fine fuel layer, default is 0.3 kg/m^2
  }
  \item{batch}{
    Whether the computation is iterative or single step, default is TRUE. When \code{batch=TRUE}, the function will calculate hourly or sub-hourly GFMC for one weather station over a period of time iteratively. If multiple weather stations are processed, an additional "id" column is required in the input to label different stations, and the data needs to be sorted by time sequence and "id".  If \code{batch=FALSE}, the function calculates only one time step (1 hour) base on either the previous hourly GFMC or the initial start value.
  }
  \item{out}{
    Output format, default is "GFMCandMC", which contains both GFMC and moisture content (MC) in a data.frame format. Other choices include: "GFMC", "MC", and "ALL", which include both the input and GFMC and MC.
  }

\details{
The Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS) is used throughout Canada, and in a number of countries throughout the world, for estimating fire potential in wildland fuels. This new Grass Fuel Moisture Code (GFMC) is an addition (Wotton 2009) to the CFFDRS and retains the structure of that System's hourly Fine Fuel Moisture Code (HFFMC) (Van Wagner 1977). It tracks moisture content in the top 5 cm of a fully-cured and fully-matted layer of grass and thus is representative of typical after winter conditions in areas that receive snowfall.  This new moisture calculation method outputs both the actual moisture content of the layer and also the transformed moisture Code value using the FFMC's FF-scale.  In the CFFDRS the moisture codes are in fact relatively simple transformations of actual moisture content such that decreasing moisture content (increasing dryness) is indicated by an increasing Code value. This moisture calculation uses the same input weather observations as the hourly FFMC, but also requires an estimate of solar radiation incident on the fuel.
}
\value{
  \code{gfmc} returns GFMC and moisture content (MC) values collectively (default) or separately.
