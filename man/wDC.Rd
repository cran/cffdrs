Overwintering Drought Code
}
\description{
\code{wDC} calculates an initial or season starting Drought Code (DC) value based on a standard method of overwintering the Drought Code (Lawson and Armitage 2008).  This method uses the final DC value from previous year, over winter precipitation and estimates of how much over-winter precipitation 'refills' the moisture in this fuel layer. This function could be used for either one weather station or for multiple weather stations.

\usage{
wDC(DCf=100,rw=200,a=0.75,b=0.75)
}
\arguments{
  \item{DCf}{ Final fall DC value from previous year}
  \item{rw}{ Winter precipitation (mm)}
  \item{a}{ User selected values accounting for carry-over fraction (view table below)}
  \item{b}{ User selected values accountain for wetting efficiency fraction (view table below)}

User-selected values and criteria for constants a and b, overwintering the Drought Code.

\details{
Of the three fuel moisture codes (i.e. FFMC, DMC and DC) making up the FWI System, only the DC needs to be considered in terms of its values carrying over from one fire season to the next.  In Canada both the FFMC and the DMC are assumed to reach moisture saturation from overwinter precipitation at or before spring melt; this is a reasonable assumption and any error in these assumed starting conditions quickly disappears.  If snowfall (or other overwinter precipitation) is not large enough however, the fuel layer tracked by the Drought Code may not fully reach saturation after spring snow melt; because of the long response time in this fuel layer (53 days in standard conditions) a large error in this spring starting condition can affect the DC for a significant portion of the fire season.  In areas where overwinter precipitation is 200 mm or more, full moisture recharge occurs and DC overwintering is usually unnecessary.  More discussion of overwintering and fuel drying time lag can be found in Lawson and Armitage (2008) and Van Wagner (1985).
